### 1. Background and Scope

This project is an extension of the initial project where I predicted the bankruptcy of JSE companies using Machine Learning models (you can find the initial project [here](https://github.com/GodfreyElia/Bankruptcy-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning/tree/main)).

I believe that the practical utility of bankruptcy prediction models lies in their ability to predict failure when it matters the most - in times of crises. Most corporate failure analysts and researchers hypothesise that times of crises negatively impact the performance of predictive models as company failure in these times is often unexpected and sudden. This means that during crises, companies may file for bankruptcy without showing indications of previous financial distress. Thus, using back-testing (modeling based on historical data), predictive models may easily misclassify candidates of bankruptcy for nonbankruptcy.
